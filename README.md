# Project Title
jdbc-dealership-project

## Description of the Project
This is a console-based dealership management application built using Java and MySQL.
It allows dealership employees to search vehicles, add new inventory, remove vehicles, and manage sales/lease contracts through a simple text menu.
The project uses the DAO pattern and JDBC to interact with the database.

## User Stories

As a dealership employee, I want to search vehicles by different filters so that I can help customers find matching options.
As a manager, I want to add new vehicles and assign them to a dealership so that the inventory stays up to date.
As a finance worker, I want to create sales and lease contracts so that customer transactions are recorded properly.
As a staff member, I want to remove vehicles that are no longer available so the database remains accurate.
